Thank you for visiting my GitHub! This is a collection of projects that I have created to show examples of work I have done in the past. Each 
folder will contain a README explaining what the program does. If you would like a version that you can easiy import to eclipse and have it work, please feel
free to contact me and I would be happy to send you the files.
